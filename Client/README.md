### **4. Technical Considerations**
```javascript
// Example API endpoints you'll need:
const adminEndpoints = {
  users: '/admin/users',          // GET/PUT/DELETE
  orders: '/admin/orders',        // GET/PUT (update status)
  products: '/admin/products',    // POST/PATCH/DELETE
  analytics: '/admin/analytics',  // GET (sales data)
  coupons: '/admin/coupons'       // POST (generate codes)
};
```

---

### **Priority Implementation Guide**
1. **Phase 1 (Week 1-2)**  
   - Order management system  
   - Basic user controls (view/ban)  
   - Product CRUD operations  

2. **Phase 2 (Week 3-4)**  
   - Revenue dashboard  
   - Inventory alerts  
   - CSV export for all data  

3. **Phase 3 (Ongoing)**  
   - Advanced analytics  
   - Marketing tools (coupons/email campaigns)  
   - Mobile admin app (if needed)  

---

### **Pro Tip: Security Essentials**
```javascript
// Always implement:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Admin activity logging
- IP whitelisting for sensitive operations
- 2FA for admin logins
```

Focus first on features that directly impact **order processing** and **inventory control**, as these are critical for daily operations. Analytics and marketing tools can be added later.


**User and Admin**
To control admin and user modules—such as handling separate logins, restricting activities by role, and managing permissions—you need to implement user authentication, define user roles, and assign access rights accordingly. Here’s how it is typically accomplished in modern software systems:

## 1. **Separate Admin and User Logins**
- **Single login form with role check:** Both admins and regular users use the same login form. After authentication, the system checks the user’s role and redirects:
  - Admin users are sent to the admin dashboard (with full privileges).
  - Regular users go to the standard user interface with limited features[1].
- **Database structure:** Maintain a users table that includes a column (e.g., `role`) identifying if the user is an ‘admin’ or ‘user’[2][1].

## 2. **User Authentication (Login)**
- Check credentials (username/email and password) against the database.
- Use session variables to keep track of logged-in users and their types (admin/user), ensuring users stay logged in across pages[3][1].

## 3. **Access Rights and Role Management**
- **Admin Module:**
  - Admins can view, edit, add, or delete users.
  - Can access all admin-only features like reports, analytics, system settings, and user management.
  - Can change passwords for themselves and others, manage system-wide settings, and view all data[4][5][6].
- **User Module:**
  - Regular users can register, log in, view, and update their own information.
  - Cannot access any admin-exclusive pages or actions[6][1].
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict areas:
  - For each page or module, check user’s role before allowing access.
  - If a user tries to access admin functionality without proper rights, redirect them or show an error[7][8].
- **Example:** In PHP, you might check `$_SESSION['role'] == 'admin'` before displaying admin pages or controls[3][1].

## 4. **Creating and Managing Roles**
- **Add or edit user roles:** Provide options in the admin panel for adding new users, assigning them roles, or upgrading roles (from user to admin).
- **Permission levels:** Define permissions such as Full Control, Write, Read, or No Access for various modules, allowing flexible assignment based on responsibility[5][7].

## 5. **Typical Admin Activities**
- User management: add, update, deactivate, or delete users.
- System settings: configure software parameters.
- View analytics, logs, and reports.
- Handle password resets and security roles.
- Oversee all content/data, and monitor system status[5][6][9][10].

## 6. **Best Practices**
- Use robust authentication (preferably with hashed passwords).
- Ensure session and role checks on every page that requires restricted access.
- Regularly audit and update roles and permissions for security.

**Summary Table: Admin vs. User Module Activities**

| Feature              | Admin                 | User                |
|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Login/Logout         | Yes                  | Yes                 |
| View own profile     | Yes                  | Yes                 |
| Manage users         | Yes                  | No                  |
| Change own password  | Yes                  | Yes                 |
| Change others’ info  | Yes                  | No                  |
| System settings      | Yes                  | No                  |
| Access to reports    | Yes                  | Sometimes/Limited   |
| View all data        | Yes                  | No                  |

This model can be implemented in any language or framework (PHP, Python, Java, etc.) by following the logical steps outlined above[6][2][1].
